<b>Trump's tariffs will hurt the USA and China more than other countries</b><br>
Trump's 25% tariff on steel will damage the global economy, but hurt the United States and net steel-exporting countries such as China more than net steel-importing countries such as Chile. The tariffs will make steel more expensive for American steel importers, who will then transfer the cost to their clients. The exact amount they transfer depends on the price elasticity of demand for steel in the American market. The higher total cost of steel will reduce demand by American importers and hence reduce global demand, which will in turn - assuming all else remains the same (ceteris paribus) - lower the global price of steel. Exporting countries will suffer due to reduced exports, but steel-importing countries such as Chile will benefit from lower prices and may increase their steel imports, which would partly offset the reduced demand from the USA. Thus, some steel consumption will be transferred from the USA to steel-importing countries. Of course, this slight benefit for these countries will likely be insufficient to compensate for the damage to the global economy. (Disclaimer: my prediction on the global price of steel in the short run depends on the ceteris paribus assumption: all else remaining the same. If other things change, then it is more complicated to predict the price of steel in the near future).

<b>Comparing DeepSeek, Chat GPT and other AI models</b><br>
Dear colleagues, I assume you have seen the news about how the AI model DeepSeek has wrought havoc on the US stock markets because it performs similar to the big AI models including Chat GPT but at a fraction of the development cost: US$ 6 million (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qw7z2v1pgo" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qw7z2v1pgo</a>). I'll share with you my own recent experience with it. I had to add 39 new references to my Mendeley from an unstructured Word file that had the references in text format. I didn't want to add them one by one, so I tried four different AI models to do the job of generating a .RIS file from the text. I tried Chat GPT, Copilot, Gemini and DeepSeek. The only one that did the job correctly was DeepSeek. The other models created incomplete .RIS files, with only half the references, or less. DeepSeek saved me time because I was able to just import the .RIS file directly into Mendeley which automatically generated the references. It's quite a thing this DeepSeek!

<b>Correlation is not transitive</b><br>
In this article I show that correlation is not transitive, i.e. x correlated with y and y correlated with z does not imply that x is correlated with z. This is important for IV regression, in which the instrument must be correlated with the explanatory variable but not with the dependent variable. The article is in the following link: <a href="Blog/Non-Transitivity-of-Correlation.html" target="_blank">Non-Transitivity-of-Correlation</a>.
