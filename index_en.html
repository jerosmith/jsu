<p>Welcome to my professional website. Through this I promote my professional services.
<p>First, a little bit about myself. I am a research economist, focusing on poverty and inequality, and the economics of innovation.</p>
<p>I was born in the UK and have lived most of my life in Chile.</p>
<p>I have a master's degree in economics from the University of Chile, a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Chile, and a graduate diploma in economics from the London School of Economics.</p>
<p>At present, I have two research jobs: at Academia Consultancy for the Digital Heritage Programme at the Chilean Ministry of Culture, and at the Economics of Innovation Research Team at the Universidad Católica Silva Henríquez.</p>
<p>I offer various services to individuals and organisations, which is the purpose of this website. I explain them in more detail in each menu. I also give some useful information and tips in the short articles and blog section.</p>
<p>I hope you find it helpful!</p>
